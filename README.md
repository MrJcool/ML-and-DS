# ML-and-DS
This repository contains files that explain various concepts in data science, such as data splitting, scaling, cleaning, hyperparameter optimization, and model selection (like regression or classification), applied to different types of datasets. These implementations were developed as part of a hands-on learning experience during a course on data science and machine learning.
